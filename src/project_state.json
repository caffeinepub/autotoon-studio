  "architecturalNotes": [
    "Frontend is a React SPA using @tanstack/react-query for server-state caching, mutations, and automatic refetch (polling when files are in processing state).",
    "Authentication is handled via a React Context provider wrapping @dfinity/auth-client (Internet Identity) and exposes login/logout plus identity state.",
    "Canister interaction is abstracted behind a custom `useActor` hook that creates an anonymous or authenticated actor and invalidates/refetches non-actor queries when identity changes.",
    "UI is built with TailwindCSS plus shadcn/ui-style components, next-themes for dark/light mode switching, and sonner for toast notifications.",
    "Backend is a Motoko actor maintaining in-memory Maps for `files` (fileId -> File record) and `users` (principal -> list of fileIds), with a migration hook scaffolded via `migration.mo`.",
    "Blob storage utilities are mixed into the backend actor via `include MixinStorage()`; authorization for deletion/GW operations is maintained in transient state fetched from a cashier canister environment variable.",
    "Backend now includes a dedicated authorization/access-control module (via `backend/authorization/*`) integrated into the main actor to enforce caller/ownership checks for file-related methods.",
    "Repository now includes a `build-template/` scaffold (React/Vite + pnpm workspace) with helper scripts (e.g., prune-unused-images, resize-images) and bundled shadcn/ui component sources for reuse/standardization across builds.",
    "Frontend linting/tooling now includes custom ESLint rules (e.g., enforcing use of the InternetIdentity provider and avoiding BigInt in React Query keys) as part of the build-template/frontend configuration.",
    "Prefer targeted, minimal-scope fixes to the specific failing area (e.g., upload, placeholder creation, playback) rather than broad project-wide code restructures, to avoid regressions like 'Actor not initialized'.",
    "Frontend now includes a dedicated placeholder-video utility for generating a minimal valid MP4 payload (instead of uploading empty/near-empty blobs) so the simulated generation pipeline produces playable artifacts.",
    "Storage client/upload path is aligned to preserve correct video MIME/type expectations for browser playback and download behavior.",
    "User confirmed they prefer whatever approach is best as long as the output video is a good-quality MP4 that can be downloaded and also appears in the gallery (i.e., use a real demo/placeholder MP4 rather than disabling playback).",
    "User requirements for demo/output video: horizontal orientation, clean animation (no overlay text), and video duration should match the uploaded audio length (they indicated 5–10 minutes / same as audio).",
    "User clarified desired output is not a generic loop/placeholder: they want full cartoon animation with scene-based characters/backgrounds and audio-synced acting/lip-sync when character dialogue is present; final MP4 duration must match the uploaded audio length.",
    "User accepted proceeding with the best feasible interim approach (not full AI scene/lip-sync yet): generate a real valid MP4 (not 85B), horizontal, clean animation, duration exactly equals uploaded audio length, and ensure it plays in-app and is downloadable/visible in gallery; keep architecture extensible for later external AI scene/lip-sync rendering integration.",
    "User confirmed interim animation approach details: (1) prioritize as-realistic-as-possible character movement/gestures within feasibility (not true AI scene/lip-sync), (2) audio source will be a single user-uploaded MP3/WAV file, (3) use generic original/royalty-free-looking cartoon characters & backgrounds (inspired-by style, not copied).",
    "Frontend public assets now include a real, valid placeholder MP4 at `frontend/public/assets/placeholders/minimal-placeholder.mp4` for placeholder video creation/playback.",
    "Frontend public assets now include a generated default gallery thumbnail image at `frontend/public/assets/generated/cartoon-gallery-thumb.dim_1280x720.png` for fallback thumbnail display.",
    "Planned/approved UI patch: update UploadSection so the whole drag-and-drop container reliably triggers the hidden file input on both mobile (touch) and desktop (click), with overlay/z-index safety to prevent blocked pointer events."
  ],
  "knownIssues": [
    "`uploadFile` uses a global `fileId` key; collisions can overwrite existing entries (no uniqueness/ownership checks).",
    "Video thumbnails are not derived from actual video content; the gallery uses a static default thumbnail and simple fallback handling.",
    "There appear to be two different `frontend/src/index.css` contents in the provided tree, suggesting a possible merge/duplication issue that could cause styling inconsistencies depending on which file is actually used.",
    "`_caffeineStorageCreateCertificate` in the storage mixin returns a fixed `{method=\"upload\"}` response and does not implement real certificate issuance/verification logic (may be intentional stub).",
    "Regression observed: audio upload can fail with a popup error \"Actor not initialized\" after broader code changes/builds.",
    "Upload can fail with “YHash must be exactly 32 bytes, got 64” / “अपलोड के दौरान अमान्य फ़ाइल हैश का पता चला” especially with ElevenLabs-downloaded MP3s, indicating a hash encoding/normalization mismatch (e.g., 64-char hex vs required 32-byte binary).",
    "After upload reaches 100% (and/or after “Audio ke sath sink…”), the UI can show “फ़ाइल नहीं मिली”, suggesting the uploaded file record/blob reference is not being persisted or is being looked up under a mismatched fileId/registry key.",
    "Upload UI regression: the drag-and-drop/select-audio area/button is not responding to clicks (file picker does not open), blocking audio upload.",
    "Upload UI regression details: user is logged in, using Chrome; upload area/button click does nothing (no popup/error) and user reports the clickable area/\"capacity\" seems reduced.",
    "Upload UI regression also affects mobile: user is logged in, on Chrome mobile at 100% zoom; tapping the entire drag-and-drop upload box does nothing (no file picker, no error), and the clickable area feels reduced."
