  "summary": "Based on the provided diff summary, the only functional change appears to be in `frontend/src/components/UploadSection.tsx`, and the accompanying `frontend-file-summaries.txt` explicitly describes implementing a full-area clickable/tappable dropzone with keyboard (Enter/Space) activation, preserved drag-and-drop behavior, and proper disabled-state handling. The `UploadSection.tsx` code itself is truncated, so direct verification of the exact implementation details is limited.",
